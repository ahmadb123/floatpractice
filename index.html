                A coastal resident often seen on wharves, jetties and docks, the western gull dresses in spectacular
                white plumage with a dark slate-gray mantle. It catches fish by diving or wading. Often seen following
                fishing boats, this gull commonly feeds on scraps thrown overboard by fish cleaners.The western gull has
                a small population, with limited distribution along the West Coast. Even though gulls prey on other
                birds, they don't deserve their reputation of being a nuisance or an undesirable pest. For example,
                their breeding areas were once destroyed because people thought the gulls preyed on black-crowned night
                herons, when actually the opposite is true. The western gull feeds largely on small, surface-feeding
                fish of no use to sport fishermen.

                Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
                that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female
                is called a pullet.Fertilized embryos develop quickly, and chicks hatch approximately 21 days later.
                Chicks are born covered in down, but they mature quickly, becoming fully feathered after four to five
                weeks. At about six months, males produce viable sperm, and females produce viable eggs. Members of
                free-ranging flocks may live for six to eight years under the best conditions, but most chickens used in
                the poultry industry serve as egg layers for two to three years before being slaughtered for their meat,

                There are only two species of beaver. The American beaver (Castor canadensis) typically weighs 60 lbs.
                (27 kilograms) and are 23 to 39 inches (60 to 100 centimeters) long. The tail adds another 7.75 to 12
                inches (20 to 30.5 cm) to its length, according to National Geographic.

                Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) are around the same size. They usually weigh from 29 to 77 lbs. (13 to
                35 kg) and are 29 to 53 in (73 to 135 cm) in length, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW) at the
                University of Michigan. Their tails are narrower and skulls are smaller than those of the American
                beaver.

                Before unleashing their speed, cheetahs use exceptionally keen eyesight to scan their grassland
                environment for signs of prey—especially antelope and hares. This big cat is a daylight hunter that
                benefits from stealthy movement and a distinctive spotted coat that allows it to blend easily into high,
                dry grasses.
                ​
                When the moment is right a cheetah will sprint after its quarry and attempt to knock it down. Such
                chases cost the hunter a tremendous amount of energy and are usually over in less than a minute. If
                successful, the cheetah will often drag its kill to a shady hiding place to protect it from
                opportunistic animals that sometimes steal a kill before the cheetah can eat. Cheetahs need only drink
                once every three to four days.

                They are the only mammals capable of self-powered flight, but they’re by no means rare. Bats account for
                about one in five of all mammals living on the planet and there are around 1,300 bat species worldwide.
                They are, however, threatened by loss of natural habitat and hunting, and many species of bat are
                considered endangered or threatened.

                Though they’re the only mammals to have developed the ability to fly, they’re extremely good at it. The
                Mexican free-tailed bat can achieve speeds up to 99 miles per hour in the air and fly as high as 10,000
                feet, as high as a bald eagle.Î

                Most foxes are around the same size as medium-sized dogs. Since foxes are smaller mammals, they are also quite light. They can weigh as little as 1.5 lbs. (680 grams) and as much as 24 lbs. (11 kg). The fennec fox is the smallest living fox and doesn't get any bigger than a cat — about 9 inches (23 centimeters) and weighing 2.2 to 3.3 lbs. (1 to 1.5 kilograms), according to National Geographic. Other species can grow to 34 inches (86 cm) from their head to their flanks. Their tails can add an additional 12 to 22 inches (30 to 56 cm) to their length.
